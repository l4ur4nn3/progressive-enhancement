    <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, 
            <ul>
                <li><q class="villager">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q></li>
            </ul>
            The farmer said, 
            <ul>
                <li><q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q></li>
            </ul>
            The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, 
            <ul>
                <li><q class="villager">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q></li>
            </ul>
            The farmer again said, 
            <ul>
                <li><q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q></li>
            </ul>
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, 
            <ul>
                <li><q class="villager">Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>.</q></li>
            </ul>
            and the farmer responded, 
            <ul>
                <li><q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q></li>
            </ul>
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, 
            <ul>
                <li><q class="villager">Isn’t that great!</q></li> 
            </ul>
            Again, he said, 
            <ul>
                <li><q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q></li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; 
            or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune. <a title="Alan Watts" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts" target="_blank">Alan Watts</a></blockquote></p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>   
        <p><span class="good">good</span> and <span class="bad">bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
